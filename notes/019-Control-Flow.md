# Control Flow

---

Control flow determines the order in which program statements are executed.

---

### **1. Comparison Operators**
Used to **compare values** and return **True/False**.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `==` | Equal to | `a == b` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `a != b` |
| `>`, `<` | Greater/Less than | `a > b` |
| `>=`, `<=` | Greater/Less than or equal to | `a <= b` |

---

### **2. Logical Operators**
Used to **combine conditions** (True/False values).

* **`and`**: True if **BOTH** conditions are True.
* **`or`**: True if **AT LEAST ONE** condition is True.
* **`not`**: **Reverses** the result (True $\rightarrow$ False).

---

### **3. Conditional Statements**
Allows the program to **make decisions** and execute code selectively.

* **`if`**: Code runs **if** the condition is True.
* **`elif`** (Else If): Checks a **new** condition if the preceding `if/elif` was False.
* **`else`**: Code runs **if all** preceding conditions were False.

---

### **4. Loops**
Used to **repeat** a block of code efficiently.

* **`for` loop**: Repeats a set number of times, typically to **iterate over a sequence** (list, range, etc.).
* **`while` loop**: Repeats **as long as** a specified condition remains True.
