# **Comparison Operators** 🧐

-----

Comparison Operators are used to **compare two values** and return a **Boolean** result (`True` or `False`).

| Operator | Meaning |
| :---: | :---: |
| `==` | Equal to |
| `!=` | Not equal to |
| `>` | Greater than |
| `<` | Less than |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to |

#### **Code Example (Java)**

This example compares two integers, $x=1$ and $y=2$.

```java
  int x = 1;
  int y = 2;
  System.out.println(x == y); // Is 1 equal to 2?
  System.out.println(x != y); // Is 1 NOT equal to 2?
  System.out.println(x < y);  // Is 1 less than 2?
  System.out.println(x <= y); // Is 1 less than or equal to 2?
  System.out.println(x > y);  // Is 1 greater than 2?
  System.out.println(x >= y); // Is 1 greater than or equal to 2?
```

#### **Output**

```
false
true
true
true
false
false
```
